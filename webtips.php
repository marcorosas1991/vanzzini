  <h1>Successful web tips</h1>

  <h2>Choose the right domain:</h2>
  <section class="text_section">
    <p>
      Your domain name is important. It represents your company’s identity on the web.
      You want it to be easy to remember. Keep your domain short, unique, and easy to spell.

  <h2>Choose the right words:</h2>
  <section class="text_section">
    <p>
      The internet is different than printed media. You need professionals to write for the web.
      Avoid wordiness, and be as direct as possible. Most people skim content these days to find what they want.
      The less you write, the most customers will read.

  <h2>Choose the right design:</h2>
  <section class="text_section">
    <p>
      Your website represents your company in the web. First impressions count, specially online.
      If a future customer feels comfortable using your website, it is more likely for him/her to stay in it.
      A good design will give confidence and build your company’s reputation.

  <section class="text_section">
    <p>
      See what others in your industry do. Learn what things they do good and wrong.
